This is a folder containing plugins that I made myself and simply decided to chuck them here for backup.

**These are not designed to be user friendly and I will offer very minimal support with these plugins.**

### Plugin Dev
Adds a set of global functions to ease with plugin development

### Devtools Extensions
Easily registers multiple devtools extensions. The extensions IDs are hard coded into the plugin since there is no UI so you have to change the array on line 16 to add or remove extensions.

Extensions registered by default are:
- [React DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
- [DevTools Theme: Zero Dark Matrix](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/devtools-theme-zero-dark/bomhdjeadceaggdgfoefmpeafkjhegbo)

<sup><sup>The code for these plugins is also quick and dirty due to my laziness. Do not use these as a example of good code. kthxbye</sup></sup>
