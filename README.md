# Enhanced Discord Plugins
EnhancedDiscord plugins that I have made.
[Support Server](discord.gg/na4WZpY)


## To download:
Either:
- Click the ED Plugin badge and your plugin will download shortly

or
- Go to the folder containing the plugin you wish to download, and grab the `.js` file in the directory.

Place it in your `EnhancedDiscord/plugins` directory. This is located wherever you first launched the exe to install EnhancedDiscord. The README showing will provide instructions and information on how to use the plugin.

Drop this line of code into your console to quickly open the plugins directory.
`require("electron").shell.openItem(require("path").join(process.env.injDir, "plugins"))`
